## Technical Background

My programming experience mainly involves writing code.  I have developed many algorithms in Python, ranging from simple to complex, and I have also coded smaller games like chess, although I donâ€™t prefer game development. Python is my main language with over three years of experience. I also have one year of experience with Java, C++, and SAS Studio each, however, I am less confident in my ability to write in C++ compared to the other languages I've learned.
